works on Data Science and Machine Learning Projects <br><br>

1 - Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction:<br><br>
consider that is the submarine so there is a war going on between 2 countries, submarine of a country is going in underwater to another country and<br>
the enemy country have planted some mines in the ocean (mines are the explosives that explodes when some object comes in contant with it, <br>
so there can be also rocks in the water so the submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing a mine or a rock,
so our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine  is a mine or a rock, submarine sends a Sonar sends sound signals and reviews switchbacks
<br>so this signals is processed to detect whether the object is a mine or rock<br><br><br>

2 - Diabetes Prediction:<br><br>
Build a Machine Learning System that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not <br><br><br>

3 - Fake news Prediction<br><br>:
Build a Machine Learning System that predict wether a news is fake or real in this case we are going to deal with textual data not numerical data
