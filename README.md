# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects
Works on Data Science and Machine Learning Projects, More Details about the project: <br><br>

1 - Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction:<br><br>
consider that is the submarine so there is a war going on between 2 countries, submarine of a country is going in underwater to another country and
the enemy country have planted some mines in the ocean (mines are the explosives that explodes when some object comes in contant with it, 
so there can be also rocks in the water so the submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing a mine or a rock,
so our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine  is a mine or a rock, submarine sends a Sonar sends sound signals and reviews switchbacks
so this signals is processed to detect whether the object is a mine or rock<br><br><br>

2 - Diabetes Prediction:<br><br>
Build a Machine Learning System that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not <br><br><br>

3 - Fake news Prediction:<br><br>
Develop a machine learning program to identify when an article might be fake news in this case we are going to deal with textual data not numerical data<br><br><br>

4 - Loan Prediction:<br><br>
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers, we are going to build a loan status prediction system that can predict whether a person is eligible for a loan or not.
